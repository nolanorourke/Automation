# Automation
Upon further investigation of what the different areas in the field, and since i think it would be really cool to learn how automation could work, espeially with AI, i am deciding to find ways to automate random tasks that i perform every day, whteher that is reminders or mundane tasks, i think it is a good idea to get familiar with the languages, libraries, and methods used in orchestration

## Tasks
I am debating on what i want this to be, i think updating perhaps the forecast would be a good idea, this would also posibly give me a way to work with APIs but i dont want to get ahead of myself
